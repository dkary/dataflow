# TODO: 
# - think about whether you really need these tests
#   I think it's worthwhile (these seem to be "external" enough behaviors)

# - Maybe consider starting with more complex funcs (e.g., get_depends)
#   Correctly identifying dependencies is the primary role of this package
#   and I can capture a variety of scenarios by testing that one function
